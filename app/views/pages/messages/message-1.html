<p><strong><u><span></span></u></strong></p>
Dear parent/carer,&nbsp;<br><br>The test results of newborn blood spot screening for your baby [insert baby&rsquo;s name] show that none of the conditions tested for are suspected.<br>
<br>Newborn blood spot screening is usually carried out when a baby is about a week old, but is offered to all babies up to a year of age. Screening involved taking some blood from your baby&rsquo;s heel. We tested your baby for:&nbsp;<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>congenital hypothyroidism (CHT)</li>
    <li>cystic fibrosis (CF)</li>
    <li>glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)</li>
    <li>homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)</li>
    <li>isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)</li>
    <li>maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)</li>
    <li>medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)</li>
    <li>phenylketonuria (PKU)</li>
    <li>sickle cell disease (SCD)</li>
</ul>
The screening results show that your baby is not thought to have any of these 9 rare conditions but please remember that screening tests are not 100% accurate.<br>
<br>Babies are being offered a screening test for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in some areas of England. This is to help decide whether to offer screening for SCID to all babies. Please note, we are not offering the screening test for SCID in your area at this time and your baby has not been screened for SCID.
<br><br>If you have any questions about your baby&rsquo;s screening results, you should discuss this with your GP or health visitor, [insert name of health visitor], who can be contacted at [insert health visitor address] or by telephoning [insert health visitor phone number].<br><br>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;<br><br>[insert signature from child health information service]<br>[insert name from child health information service]<br><br><br></p>
